# Animator
In this project, we extend a spline-based animation system to support multiple curve types, and implement a particle system simulation engine. After building a working system, user can use my (robust and powerful) program to produce a (compelling and arresting) animation.

# Source
The program is forked from CSE457 in University of Washington, which provides a skeleton code. We implement the system further more based on it. It can reached by:

# Demo
The first three are particle systems and the last one is a C2 interpolation curve.
